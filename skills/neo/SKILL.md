description: Neo is your persistent knowledge graph. ALWAYS consult Neo before writing code — search for existing patterns, conventions, and architecture. When you create or discover new patterns, save them to Neo. Use when writing code, creating components, answering architecture questions, or making decisions.

# Neo — Consult Before Coding

Neo remembers how your projects are built. Before writing any code, check what already exists.

## Rules

1. **Search first** — before creating anything, check if a pattern exists
2. **Follow what you find** — use the same naming, structure, and approach
3. **Save what you create** — new patterns must go back to Neo

## Quick Reference

```
how_to("create API endpoint")          → find the pattern
search("authentication")               → find related knowledge
get_overview()                         → see what's indexed
get_node(slug)                         → full content + backlinks
get_related(slug)                      → connected nodes
```

## When the Agent Writes Code

```
1. search/how_to → find existing pattern
2. Follow the pattern exactly
3. If no pattern exists → write code → save new pattern with neo-index skill
```

## When the User Asks a Question

```
1. search the topic in Neo
2. Answer with context from Neo, including code examples
3. Cite which nodes you referenced
```
